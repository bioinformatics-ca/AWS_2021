# Module 4: Searching and sorting files

## Setup

The first step will be to download some example data. First move into your home directory, download the example data as a zip file and then unzip the file:

```bash
cd ~
wget http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip
unzip data-shell.zip
```

## Data Exploration

```
cd ~
cd data-shell
```
